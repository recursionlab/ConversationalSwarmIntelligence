### Key Points

- 1 Morphological Computing as Logic Underlying Cognition in Human, Animal, and Intelligent Machine  Gordana Dodig-Crnkovic 1,2,* 1 Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, 412 96 Gothenburg, Sweden 2 School of Innovation, Design and Engineering, Computer Science Laboratory, MÃ¤lardalen University, Sweden  Abstract This work examines the interconnections between logic, epistemology, and sciences within the Naturalist tradition

- Introduction Morphological computing and cognition refer to the study of how physical structures and processes in biological systems contribute to information processing and cognitive functions

- â€¢ creating new cognitive models and theories that integrate morphological computing and logic to better understand human and animal cognition

- By connecting morphological computing and cognition to practical logic and logic in action, we aim to develop new ways of designing and building artificial intelligence systems, robots, and cognitive models that are more closely aligned with the principles found in natural biological systems
