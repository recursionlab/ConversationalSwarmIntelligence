# Quantum Computing
Quantum computing uses quantum bits (qubits) which can be in superpositions.
## Entanglement
Entanglement allows qubits to be correlated in ways impossible in classical systems.
## Superposition
Superposition enables simultaneous computation of multiple states.
# Machine Learning
Machine learning algorithms learn from data.
## Supervised Learning
Data is labeled and algorithms learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.
